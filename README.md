## About me
### Hiya. Thanks for visiting my page. I spent a good portion of my life learning to become an architect however things didn't work out and so I am now a transitioned software dev. I'm an incredibly fast learner when it comes to tech things. Anyways looking forward to collaborting with you all. ðŸ˜„

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as an intermediate full stack web developer in South Africa. Current stack that I work with: React Nextjs FE framework with a PHP Laravel BE with a sprinkling of Typescript and gCloud on the side.
- ðŸŒ± Growing and learning are my main priorities right now.
- ðŸ¦¾ Incredibly proficient at Git.
- ðŸ¤” Open to discussing anything code and tech related.
- ðŸ˜¢ Work has me playing with Bitbucket all day so my contributions here definitely don't reflect all that I do. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Contact me through my Github or my Linkedin page <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alankow11/">here.</a>
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm notoriously easy to get along with. ðŸ˜Š
