## About me
### Hiya. Thanks for visiting my page. I spent a good portion of my life learning to become an architect however things didn't work out and so I am now a transitioned software dev. I'm an incredibly fast learner when it comes to tech things. Anyways looking forward to collaborting with you all. 😄
