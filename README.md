## About me
### Hiya. Thanks for visiting my page. I spent a good portion of my life learning to become an architect however things didn't work out and so I am currently transitioning to becoming a web developer. I'm quite new to Github and Git and well... everything haha but I am a fast learner and so I'm sure I'll be contributing a lot more as time goes by. ^^ Anyways looking forward to collaborting with you all.
