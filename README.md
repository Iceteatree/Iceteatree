## About me
### Hiya. Thanks for visiting my page. I spent a good portion of my life learning to become an architect however things didn't work out and so I am now a transitioned software dev. I'm an incredibly fast learner when it comes to tech things. Anyways looking forward to collaborting with you all. ðŸ˜„

- ðŸ”­ Current stack that I work with: React & Typescript Nextjs FE framework with a PHP Laravel BE and a sprinkling of gCloud goodness.
- ðŸŒ± Growing and learning are my main priorities right now.
- ðŸ¦¾ Incredibly proficient at Git.
- ðŸ¤” Open to discussing anything code and tech related.
- ðŸ˜¢ Work has me playing with Bitbucket all day so my contributions here definitely don't reflect all that I do.
